# 👋 Hi, I'm Jennie Butch!

I'm a Software Engineering student at Northern Arizona University (Dec 2024) with a strong interest in embedded systems, firmware testing, and full-stack web development. I love solving problems at both low and high levels — from writing efficient C unit tests to building responsive web apps in React.
